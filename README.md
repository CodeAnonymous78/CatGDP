## Shoutouts

- The `Streamlit-chat` component at https://github.com/AI-Yash/st-chat. Though I didn't end up including the project directly as a requirement because there were some details I could not control, I was inspired by their CSS design and edited it for my own purposes and implemented in this and many of my other chatbot projects.
